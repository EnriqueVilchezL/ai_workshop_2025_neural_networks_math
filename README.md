# The Mathematics of Neural Networks

## Description
This repository contains the code and materials used in the session of the workshop **"The Mathematics of Neural Networks"**. In this session, we explore the mathematical foundations of neural networks, including:

- Linear algebra applied to neural networks.
- Differential calculus and integrals in model learning.
- Optimization using gradient descent.
- Implementation of a simple neural network from scratch.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a deep understanding of the underlying concepts of neural networks, without relying on high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Requirements
To follow this workshop and run the included code, you will need:

- Knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.
- Python 3.x installed.
- The following Python libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib tkinter
  ```
